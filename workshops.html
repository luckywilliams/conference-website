              <h3>Janet Andrews - Feedback: Dealing with The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</h3>
              <p>Janet has over 20 years of experience as a coach, consultant and business leader with emphasis on organizational strategy and change, and leadership development. She believes that high performing organizations and impacts start with individual leadership, no matter what role/level a person is within an organization. Janet helps leaders transition into new roles, maximize their opportunity, and build more resilient teams and programs. Learn more at <a href="http://www.consociata.com/" target="_blank">Consociata</a>.</p>
              <p>If the idea of providing (or receiving) constructive feedback doesn't make you feel warm and fuzzy, you aren't alone. As social creatures, we like to be in harmony with others around us. However, our innovation and growth as individuals, and as teammates, are predicated on us taking in new perspectives - some of which may be counter to our existing beliefs. During this workshop, Janet will share with us the ins and outs of the feedback process that will help us be better prepared for these inevitable, everyday exchanges that we often find difficult and awkward. We'll learn to appreciate our human wiring towards feedback and conflict, notice our personal triggers, and understand how to apply empathetic listening as giver and receiver.</p>

              <h3>Nancy Jensen - Swinging Back and Forth to Work</h3>
              <p>Nancy is CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="http://www.theswingshift.co/" target="_blank">The Swing Shift</a>, the destination for women in career transition. She’s been featured in The Huffington Post, at Seattle’s infamous F-Bomb Breakfast Club and the Female Founders Alliance Champion Awards. The Swing Shift is on its 5th cohort, and a semi-finalist at Social Venture Partners 2017 Fast Pitch competition. Nancy believes that women shouldn’t be penalized for taking care of their families, is committed to getting women into the workforce on their own terms, and dedicated to 100% pay parity.</p>
              <p>Are you looking to transition back into, or away from, a traditional workforce role? As many as 60% of women are looking to shift roles according to a 2017 Harris study, and as we know 43% of women take a break to raise their families. Let's talk about the current situation, what's needed for women who are looking to step back from full time and part time work, as well as women who are looking to step back in after a break. What resources do you need to make this switch, what are the barriers that you can expect in each case, and how can you overcome them? </p>
