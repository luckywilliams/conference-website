            <h3>Swinging Back and Forth to Work</h3>
            <p>Are you looking to transition back into, or away from, a traditional workforce role? As many as 60% of women are looking to shift roles according to a 2017 Harris study, and as we know 43% of women take a break to raise their families. Let's talk about the current situation, what's needed for women who are looking to step back from full time and part time work, as well as women who are looking to step back in after a break. What resources do you need to make this switch, what are the barriers that you can expect in each case, and how can you overcome them?</p>

            <h3>Feedback: Dealing with The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</h3>
            <p>If the idea of providing (or receiving) constructive feedback doesn't make you feel warm and fuzzy, you aren't alone. As social creatures, we like to be in harmony with others around us. However, our innovation and growth as individuals, and as teammates, are predicated on us taking in new perspectives - some of which may be counter to our existing beliefs. During this workshop, Janet will share with us the ins and outs of the feedback process that will help us be better prepared for these inevitable, everyday exchanges that we often find difficult and awkward. We'll learn to appreciate our human wiring towards feedback and conflict, notice our personal triggers, and understand how to apply empathetic listening as giver and receiver.</p>
